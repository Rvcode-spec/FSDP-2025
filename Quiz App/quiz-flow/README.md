Quiz App
A simple quiz application that fetches questions from a backend API and allows users to answer them. The app calculates the user's score and displays their answers at the end of the quiz.

Project Overview
This project consists of two parts:

Backend (Express.js):

Handles the API requests and serves the quiz data to the frontend.
Implements a CORS policy for frontend-backend communication.
Frontend (React.js):

Displays the quiz questions and options.
Allows users to select answers and tracks their responses.
Displays the final score and user answers once the quiz is completed.
